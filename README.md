My implementation of Role Based Access Control System

1. The project is divided into two packages. One is client and other is server. Purpose was to have separation of concerns
2. User interacts with UserService.
3. For the backend logic, entry point is AccessService. Rest all classes are made package private
4. This project contains two services. One is UserService and other is AccessService.
5. Test data is written in main class. Main class can be run to see the results.
